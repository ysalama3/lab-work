## Here is a markdown file

Those `#` symbols above indicate that we want a heading. 

We can italicize characters by wrapping them in a pair of asterisks (`*`): for example, *here is some italicized text*

We can bold characters by wrapping them in a pair of two asterisks (`**`): for example, **here is some bolded text**

We can italicize and bold characters by wrapping them in a pair of three asterisks (`***`): for example, ***here is some italicized text*** 

We can include links in this way: `[text we want to show up](link we want it to point to)`: for example, [this is a link to the course github page](http://eeb177-w17.github.io)

We can include figures in this way: `![alt-text-to-figure](link to figure or path to figure)`: for example, ![this is picture of an awesome forest in New Guinea](http://www.abc.net.au/cm/lb/7231362/data/4-tree-diversity-data.jpg)
